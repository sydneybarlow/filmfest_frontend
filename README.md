# filmfest_frontend
FilmFest is a project that I built in one week using OOJS and Semantic UI.

This was designed as a platform to submit films to a film festival circuit. Here you can fill out a form that adds a film to to the movies list.

Also, there are already made tickets that have information about the movie available. In the tickets you can change the date of when you are going, if you wish to go at another time. 

You can also delete the ticket if, for whatever reason, you do not wish to go anymore.

Inside of the movies cards at the bottom that display the movies that are being shown at teh film festival. There is an option of getting a ticket. For now, buying a movie ticket is not available. That is my next functionality that I wish to add. As of right now, if you click on 'Get Tickets' it imeddiately changes to 'Sold Out'...which is sad. These are good movies and everyone should see them. 

Open the index.html inside of your browser to see the app. Also run 'rails s' with the backend portion of this project to get it to work.
